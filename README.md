Prediction of gender using python on survey data


Dataset reference : Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/miroslavsabo/young-people-survey

Survey conducted in 2013 so as to understand the preferences of young individuals of Slovakian nationality. The survey asked its participants a range of questions such as music and movie preference, phobia, spending habit etc. Each of the response was recorded on the scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest (Strongly disagree) and 5 being highest(Strongly agree). The age bracket chosen for the survey was 15 to 30 years.
The responses include a wide variety of selections/columns which give enough details about the characteristic/personal traits and preferences of young individuals.

I have done basic data cleaning and analysis in python using Pandas library. I have searched for correlation analysis between various choice parameters and personality paramters of age, gender etc. The most correlated column was the gender column and was hence used for further predictions. Have includede a comparitive analysis of various algorithms for prediction such as logitic regression, SVM, ANN.
